# LCM
The code calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two positive integers by first computing their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using a recursive function based on the Euclidean algorithm. It then uses the relationship between GCD and LCM to find the LCM efficiently. The program repeatedly prompts the user to enter two positive integers, rejecting zero or negative inputs to ensure valid data. It outputs the computed LCM in a clear format.

# Tower of Hanoi
The code implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of integers provided by the user. It compares adjacent items in the list, swapping them if they are in the wrong order, and prints detailed messages showing each comparison and whether a swap occurred. After each full pass through the list where swaps happen, it displays the current state of the list to track the sorting progress. The process repeats until the list is fully sorted, and the final sorted list is then displayed.

Making both programs was a great way to improve my coding skills. In the first program, I learned how to use recursion to find the greatest common divisor and then calculate the least common multiple. It also helped me practice checking user input to make sure the numbers were positive. The second program taught me how bubble sort works by comparing and swapping numbers until the list is sorted. I enjoyed adding detailed print statements to show each comparison and swap, which made the process easier to understand. These exercises helped me become more confident in writing functions and working with loops.
